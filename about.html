It involves not just the visual aesthetics but also the functionality and user experience of a site. Hereâ€™s an overview of what designing as a web developer entails:

            Key Aspects of Web Design for Developers
            User Experience (UX) Design:
            
            User Research: Understanding the target audience, their needs, and their behaviors.
            Wireframing: Creating low-fidelity sketches or prototypes to map out the structure and layout of a website.
            Usability: Ensuring that the website is easy to navigate and that users can find what they need with minimal effort.
            Interaction Design: Designing how users interact with the website, including buttons, forms, and other interactive elements.
            User Interface (UI) Design:
            
            Visual Design: Creating the look and feel of the website, including color schemes, typography, and imagery.
            Layout: Arranging elements on the page to create a visually appealing and functional design.
            Responsiveness: Designing for different devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent experience across platforms.
            Accessibility: Making sure the website is usable by people with disabilities, including considerations for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
            Design Tools:
            
            Graphic Design Software: Tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma for creating mockups and visual elements.
            Prototyping Tools: Software like Adobe XD, Sketch, and InVision for creating interactive prototypes and gathering feedback.
            Web Design Frameworks: Knowledge of frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize for implementing design elements quickly.
            Front-End Development:
            
            HTML/CSS: Translating design mockups into code, ensuring that designs are implemented accurately and responsively.
            JavaScript: Adding interactivity and dynamic features to enhance user experience.
            Design Systems: Using or creating design systems and style guides to maintain consistency across the website or application.
